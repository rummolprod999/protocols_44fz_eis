# Project Requirements for protocols_44fz_eis

## Overview

This document outlines the key requirements and goals for the protocols_44fz_eis project, which is designed to parse and
process procurement protocols from the Russian Federal Law 44-FZ Electronic Information System (EIS) via FTP.

## Functional Requirements

### Data Acquisition

1. Connect to the EIS FTP server to download protocol files
2. Handle various protocol file formats (XML)
3. Support timeout handling for unreliable connections
4. Process ZIP archives containing protocol files

### Data Processing

1. Parse different types of procurement protocols (EF, EOK, EZK, etc.)
2. Extract relevant information from XML files
3. Convert XML data to structured format for database storage
4. Handle protocol-specific parsing logic through specialized classes

### Data Storage

1. Store parsed protocol data in a MySQL database
2. Maintain data integrity and relationships
3. Support efficient querying of protocol information

### Logging and Monitoring

1. Log all parsing activities for debugging and auditing
2. Track errors and exceptions during the parsing process
3. Provide status updates for long-running operations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

1. Process large volumes of protocol files efficiently
2. Optimize memory usage when handling large XML files
3. Implement appropriate timeout mechanisms for network operations

### Reliability

1. Handle network errors gracefully
2. Recover from parsing failures without losing data
3. Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations

### Maintainability

1. Follow consistent coding standards
2. Provide adequate documentation for code and architecture
3. Implement modular design for easier maintenance and extension

### Security

1. Secure database connections
2. Handle credentials securely
3. Validate and sanitize input data

## Constraints

1. Compatibility with the EIS FTP server protocol
2. Compliance with Federal Law 44-FZ data structures
3. Dependency on external libraries (PyMySQL, xmltodict, etc.)
4. Operation within available system resources
